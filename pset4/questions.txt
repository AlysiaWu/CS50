0.  BMP - supports 16M colours
    GIF - 256
    JPEG - 16M
    PNG - 256T
    
1.  Of these file types, only GIF supports animation

2.  Lossy compression discards some data in order to reduce data size.
    Lossless compression does not lose any data.
   
3.  Of these file types, JPEG is lossy-compressed

4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT file system, the file data remains in memory - the pointers to that file are deleted

5.  Files can be overwritten (in memory) to ensure with high probability that the 'deleted' files cannot be recovered.

6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 
    to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width 
    integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros (wikibooks)
    
7.  using these types allows use across different platforms

8.  BYTE - 1 byte
    DWORD - 3
    LONG - 3
    WORD - 2

9.  The first 3 bytes of any BMP file must be 'B' and 'M'

10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file
    biSize is the size, ibytes, of the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER
    
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is "top-down", and its origin is in the upper-left corner

12. The field biBitCount specifies the file's colour-depth (the number of bits per pixel)

13. fopen() might return null if the file doesn't exist, or the user doesn't have correct permissions

14. because we only want to read it once

15. padding = 3

16. fseek() changes the offset of a file pointer

17. SEEK_CUR is the current location of the file pointer
